Python/Tkinter item calculator for SimCity BuildIt.

![](https://github.com/sdfwer124/simter/blob/master/simter.png?raw=true)

This GUI application is a utility with which to keep track of items necessary for building upgrades.

All items produced in commercial buildings are displayed as buttons.
Each time a button is clicked, a dictionary is modified containing keys for items needed,
and printed to the screen after performing calculations to the other items. 
For example, 2 boards are needed to produce 1 ladder.
When the ladder is clicked,
the value for "ladders" is incremented
while "boards" is increments by 2.

Sweet!
